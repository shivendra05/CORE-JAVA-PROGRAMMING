	/*3. Anonymous Inner Class
	 * 
	 * a normal java class can extends only one class and ofcourse anonymous inner class can extend only one class
	 * a normal java class can implements any number of interfaces but anonymous inner class can implement only one interface at a time
	 * a normal java class can extend a class and can implements any number of interfaces simultaneously but anonymous inner class can extend a class or can implement only one interface at a time but not simultaneously
	 * 
	 * normal java class we can write any number of constructor but in anonymous inner class we cant write any constructor
	 * explicitly because name of the constructor name and constructor is same but anonymous inner class have no name.
	 * 
	 * if the requirement is standard and required several time, then we should go for top level class
	 * if the requirement is temporary and required only one(instance use) then we should go for anonymous inner class
	 * 
	 * we can use anonymous inner class frequently in GUI based application to implement event handling.
