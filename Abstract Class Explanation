Java Programming provides two types of Class
1. abstract class
2. concreate class 

Concreate methods are fully defined methods. Where as abstract method doesn't have any body. 
Abstact methods, are just declaretion of methods(undefined method) preceeded by abstract keyword.

Concreate classs caotains fuly  defined method.
A class which is having atleast one method with abstract keyword(undefined method), known as abstract class and that class starts with abstract keyword

abstract class can contains, both concreate and abstract method.

Points need to remember:
1. We can create obbject of Abstract class directly.But we can create object of abstract class with its implimentation class(derived sub class).
2. abstract method cant be final, static and private. Because abstract class conatains abstract method and that must be overriden, manny times called throughout the prog. 
3. if derived class is  not implimenting all abstract method present in base class, derived class must be preceeded by abstract keyword as well.
